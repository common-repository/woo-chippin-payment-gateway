Chippin is a shared payment gateway that enables merchants to allow their customers to split the cost of any purchase with others.

== Description ==

Chippin is a shared payment gateway that allows you, the merchant, the ability to offer group buying for a single order. This means that a customer can split the cost of a purchase with other people.

At the end of the checkout process, the customer can choose to "Pay by Chippin" and their basic details are sent across to Chippin with your unique order reference. The customer can then invite others to chip in for the item(s) they are purchasing.

Chippin is a simple 'plug-in' that integrates quickly and seamlessly into your online checkout. It enables consumers to easily split the cost of an online transaction safely and securely to their own and your benefit.

=== Features ===

The features of Chippin provide a compelling option for merchants that are not currently maximising the opportunities of the gifting market or group purchases. Consumers benefit from a simple solution to share the payments required to purchase a gift or group purchase.

==== New customer acquisition ====

Chippin gives direct contact with previously unseen and/or unknown customers - i.e. it gives access to those indirectly buying through others (e.g. tickets, gifts, holidays etc.). Whether a contributor accepts or declines the invitation, they are redirected to the merchant's website â€“ better than any normal referral.

==== Increase AOV ====

The social reach of Chippin allows customers to target higher price points - i.e. more people splitting the cost.

==== Boost the brand ====

Increase traffic to and engagement on the website, providing a new, valuable service to consumers. Also, provides other marketing and promotional opportunities - e.g. special promotions for group purchases and/or the organisers of group purchases.

==== Allays traditional fears ====

Chippin eliminates the anxiety of today's manual group paying process - e.g. people failing to commit, having to chase payment; being paid in cash all at once (e.g. ticket sales); and being left 'out of pocket'.

==== Saves time and energy ====

simple set-up, invitation and tracking process makes activating and managing a Chippin transaction an easy, fair, and pain-free process. By choosing to guarantee the full amount, the instigator can also ensure a successful transaction.

==== Opportunity to 'buy better' ====

Chippin helps to make the more aspirational affordable for all - i.e. a group of friends are more readily able to consider higher priced items in a trouble-free manner.
